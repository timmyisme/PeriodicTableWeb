<h1>Oxygen</h1>
<p>Oxygen is the most fundamental resource for all living organisms on earth. It is a colorless, odorless, tasteless gas. It has 8 protons, neutrons, and electrons in its most stable isotope. It is the most abundant element on earth's surface and it closely follows hydrogen and helium as the 3rd most abundant element in the universe. With only two electrons short of a full valence shell, oxygen can pair with metals like beryllium, magnesium, calicum, and countless others.</p>
<p>Virtually all living organisms that aren't plants require oxygen in order to survive. It makes up more than half of human bodies, and is necessary for respiration. In addition, oxygen is an oxidant, it engages and supports chemical reactions and fuels fires, even able to bond with itself to give us O2, the air we breathe.</p>
<p>Without oxygen, almost no organisms would be able to survive on earth. So, reduce Carbon emissions and keep our planet clean!</p>
