<h1>Carbon</h1>
<p>Carbon, typically with 6 protons, electrons, and neutrons, is also the 6th most abundant element in the universe. It is a nonmetal with characteristics that are dark-gray/black, soft, and is similar texture to the graphite in pencils. However, carbon is not limited to a solid state; it is extremely receptive to bonding with other elements. When combined with other elements, carbon can create essential gases like CO2, liquid fuel like crude oil, and even valuable gemstones like diamonds.</p>
<p>Carbon is the backbone to all life on earth. Being the second most abundant element in human bodies, it's safe to say we cannot live without it. Carbon is what makes up almost all of fossil fuel compositions, allowing us to exploit these resources for cheap energy.</p>
<p>Carbon truly is a one-of-a-kind element that we should cherish and preserve.</p>
